Idris mode for vim
==================

This is an [Idris][] mode for vim which features syntax highlighting, indentation
and optional syntax checking via [Syntastic][]. If you need a REPL I recommend using
[Vimshell][].

## Installation

I recommend using [Pathogen][] for installation. Simply clone
this repo into your `~/.vim/bundle` directory and you are ready to go.

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-vim.git

### Manual Installation

Copy content into your `~/.vim` directory.

Be sure that the following lines are in your
`.vimrc`


    syntax on
    filetype on
    filetype plugin indent on

## Features

Apart from syntax highlighting, indentation, and unicode character concealing,
idris-vim offers some neat interactive editing features. For more information on
how to use it, read this blog article by Edwin Brady on [Interactive Idris editing with vim][].

## Interactive Editing Commands

[Idris][] mode for vim offers interactive editing capabilities, the following
commands are supported.

`<LocalLeader>r` reload file

`<LocalLeader>t` show type

`<LocalLeader>d` Create an initial clause for a type declaration.

`<LocalLeader>b` Same as \d but for an initial typeclass method impl.

`<LocalLeader>md` Same as \d but for a proof clause

`<LocalLeader>c` case split

`<LocalLeader>mc` make case

`<LocalLeader>w` add with clause

`<LocalLeader>e` evaluate expression

`<LocalLeader>l` make lemma

`<LocalLeader>m` add missing clause

`<LocalLeader>f` refine item

`<LocalLeader>o` obvious proof search

`<LocalLeader>p` proof search

`<LocalLeader>i` open idris response window

`<LocalLeader>h` show documentation

## Configuration

### Indentation

To configure indentation in `idris-vim` you can use the following variables:

* `let g:idris_indent_if = 3`

        if bool
        >>>then ...
        >>>else ...

* `let g:idris_indent_case = 5`

        case xs of
        >>>>>[]      => ...
        >>>>>(y::ys) => ...

* `let g:idris_indent_let = 4`

        let x = 0 in
        >>>>x

* `let g:idris_indent_where = 6`

        where f : Int -> Int
        >>>>>>f x = x

* `let g:idris_indent_do = 3`

        do x <- a
        >>>y <- b

* `let g:idris_indent_rewrite = 8`

        rewrite prf in expr
        >>>>>>>>x

### Concealing

Concealing with unicode characters is off by default, but `let g:idris_conceal = 1` turns it on.

### Tab Characters

If you simply must use tab characters, and would prefer that the ftplugin not set expandtab add `let g:idris_allow_tabchar = 1`.
